# my-bash-aliases
This repository contains bash aliases I regularly use to improve productivity.

Usage:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashears/my-bash-aliases/master/content >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashears/my-bash-aliases/master/.vimrc >> ~/.vimrc
```

This will append the content into your machines bash_profile, and then load that profile for immediate use.
